Our motivation for choosing this topic stems from several recent events including racial hate crimes, police brutality concerns, crimes influenced by political polarization etc. across the world. Thus we intend to analyze the trend of crimes over time, possible seasonalities and other influential factors. Some questions which we expect to address include: What roles do location, demographics, literacy and other external factors play on the frequency and type/severity of crimes? What are the factors leading to a certain type of crime? This includes a wide group of crimes such as social, financial, cyber, hate influenced, those influenced by political opinions, intellectual property, drug abuse, human trafficking, sexual crimes, domestic abuse and assault, insider trading etc. Further analyzing events that may have caused an increase of such crimes Were complaints filed for these crimes and how did the authorities deal with said crimes? Were accusations wrong? How policy change has affected crime rates? Does increasing punishment type, degree and duration reduce crime? Has COVID-19 affected the crime rates/types/frequency and how so? 1.2 Other references https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/covid/Property_Crime_Brief_2020.pdf https://covid19.counciloncj.org/2021/01/31/impact-report-covid-19-and-crime-3/ https://www.nap.edu/read/18613/chapter/5#71 1.3 Link between data and questions: These datasets span a large class of crimes which include information about demographics, along with information of types and severity, helping us gain insight into answers about these questions. For instance, the answers to question 2 and 5 will require a more nuanced understanding of certain events (political, financial, COVID) and understanding of the influencing factors behind these crimes. This would require correlation of the type of the crime and the point/interval of time when these events (political/financial etc) took place. Answers to question 3 can be found through matching the crime records data and the crime complaint data. Often, policy changes are influential in affecting the crimes. Using data of policy changes through the years, and the types/counts of crimes that took place over the years, we wish to find insights on crime trends.

These crimes include Criminal Mischief, Grand Larceny and offenses against public administration, among others. 5.3.2 Assault Offenses by Borough It is also important to identify crime rates by Borough to see which regions of New York are most affected by these crimes. Here we are focusing on assault related crimes since these are most prevalent in NYC. It is seen that Bronx and Brooklyn are most affected by Assault related offenses, whereas Staten Island is least affected. A basic cause for this could be assumed to be population of these boroughs but it is important to note here that while population decreases in the following order: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, Staten Island, this is not the trend of assault crimes. 5.3.3 Offenses by Borough and Age Group We try to further drill down among the NYC boroughs to understand if perpetrator age plays a role in these statistics. The above plots show a similar trend across Boroughs with a majority of perpetrators belonging to the 25-44 age group. However it is important to note here that except for Manhattan, the number of perpetrators belonging to the 18-24 category are more than those belonging to 45-64 age group. 5.3.4 Identifying race of perpetrators by Borough It can also be valuable to know if there is a trend in perpetrator race for each borough. The majority of perpetrator race seen here is Black, followed by White Hispanic. However it is important to note some other points as well: State Island sees a similar distribution of Black as well as White perpetrators Queens has a larger share of perpetrators belonging to Asian community The Bronx has a very small percentage of perpetrators who are White. On the contrary, Black Hispanic is a more common group. 5.3.5 Drugs based crimes in NYC 5.3.5.1 Drug Based Crimes Density by Location 5.3.6 Sexual Crimes An important aspect of crime analysis is understanding trends in sexual crimes and what areas are they more frequent in. The above location based scatter plot shows the spread in location where sexual crimes tend to occur. To get a clearer picture, we plot the below density curve. 5.3.6.1 Sexual Crimes Frequency by Location This plot identifies certain locations which tend to have a higher frequency of sexual crimes in NYC. 5.4 Hate Crimes 5.4.0.1 Insights Kings County (Brooklyn) had the highest total number of hate crimes over the years 2019 and 2020. This was followed by New York (Manhattan) and then Queens. The only county/borough to have experienced an upturn in hate crimes in 2020 was the Richmond county (Staten Island Borough). This is confirmed by articles such as (Source: silive.com https://www.silive.com/crime-safety/2021/04/staten-island-was-the-only-borough-in-nyc-with-an-increase-in-hate-crimes-in-2020-why-where-were-they-crime-analysis.html) 5.4.0.2 Insights The largest proportion of hate crimes stem from religious reasons, followed by race and sexual orientation. Kings County (Brooklyn) has a much larger proportion of these religious crimes. Interestingly, although the total number of hate crimes is greater in Kings County (Brooklyn) than New York County (Manhattan), the number of crimes stemming from Sexual Orientation and Race/Color is greater in New York County than Kings County. 5.4.0.3 Insights Anti- Jewish hate crimes seem to be the largest in number (by a large amount, almost 350 crimes) during this time period, followed by anti-homosexual (gay) and anti-black crimes. 5.4.0.4 Insights As expected from the previous 2 graphs, Kings County (Brooklyn) has the highest number of anti-jewish crimes. Kings County has a disproportionately large number of these crimes, whereas other motive types like anti-black or anti-homosexual seem to be equal in the boroughs of Kings and New York (Manhattan). These insights are confirmed by articles such as (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nypd-to-increase-presence-in-brooklyn-after-string-of-anti-semitic-hate-crimes/ Source: CBS News) 5.4.0.5 Insights Across the city of New York, the number of hate crimes went down in 2020 (by almost 40%). Sexual orientation crimes decreased, whereas crimes based on race/color unfortunately went up in number. 5.4.0.6 Insights Across both years, it is visible that there is a dependance on the month when it comes to the number of crimes. However, for all months, 2020 had lower number of hate crimes than there were in 2019. The highest crime number for both years was in the month of March. 5.4.0.7 Insights The insights from this mosaic plot corroborate our findings from the previous plots. 5.4.0.8 Insights The majority of arrests, if made, were made within 50 days since the report creation, for both the years 2019 and 2020. This indicates a heavy right-skew in the graphs. Only very few arrests were made beyond the 50-day mark in both years. 5.4.0.9 Insights Criminal Mischief, Aggravated Assault and Aggravated Harrassment were the most code of hate crimes committed. ## [1] 149 5.4.0.10 Insights Unfortunately, the majority of offenders in hate crimes during 2019 and 2020 have not been arrested. 506 offenders were not arrested, whereas 222 arrests were made. This picture might be offset in the case of one person commited multiple hate crimes and then being arrested. As we do not have information regarding arrest details, such analysis is omitted here. 5.5 Drugs 5.5.1 Arrests related to all drugs throughout US 5.5.1.1 Insights: all drugs The number of drug related arrests across the United States peaked around the years 2005-2007 over the entire course of 1994 - 2016. The lowest number of drug-related arrests were during 1994. The high number of drug related arrests coincides with the A large portion of the arrests related to upturn in drug-related arrests could be due to the raids detailed in articles such as: https://www.justice.gov/archive/usao/nye/pr/2005/2005dec7.html. In addition, this could also be because of the setting up of the Digital Evidence Laboratory by the Drug Enforcement Administration. (Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration) 5.5.2 Arrests related to manufacture and possession 5.5.2.1 Insights: Manufacturing vs Possession As seen in the graph, the number of arrests in relation to manufacturing of drugs has seen a downward trend, where the number of arrests in relation to possession of drugs has seen an upward trend. It is unclear whether the trends are due to a decrease in the manufacturing or due to other factors such as ineffectual police techniques. Similarly, the upward trend in the possession arrests of drugs could be due to either in increase in drug consumption or better police techniques to find such people to arrest, or both. 5.5.3 Arrests related to Manufacturing 5.5.3.1 Insights: Manufacturing Insights The trends seen in the manufacture of these drugs is highly interesting. It is seen that the arrests related to opioid manufacture have seen a sharp downturn in the 1994-2016 period. In contrast, other drug-related arrests have been on the upturn, including marijuana, synthetic drugs and other drugs. 5.5.4 Arrests related to Possession 5.5.4.1 Insights: Drug Possession Arrests As can be seen from the scale of the graph, it is evident that the number of arrests due to drug possession are higher than the number of arrests in connection with drug manufacturing. In correlation with the manufacturing downtrend of opioid, the number of arrests for possession of opioid has also seen a downtrend. Again, similar to the manufacturing uptrend for other drugs such as marijuana or synthetic, the number of arrests have also been increasing during the 1993-2016 timeframe. 5.5.5 Arrests as a proportion of population 5.5.5.1 Insights: Population Proportion It is seen that there is a downward trend in the proportion of the us population arrested in connection to drugs. This could be due to the fact that the population growth has outstripped the number of drug manufacturers/possesors over this time frame (since it was seen that arrests have been on the increase during this timeframe). 5.6 Park Crime Data "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Testing Interactive Setup "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "]]
